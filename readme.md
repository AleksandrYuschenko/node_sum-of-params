# Sum of params

**Read [the guideline](https://github.com/mate-academy/js_task-guideline/blob/master/README.md) before start**

- Read params from a command line and print the result of addition or multiplication
  - `node src/app.js add 1 2 3 4 5` should print 15 - the sum of all numbers
  - `node src/app.js multiply 3 4 5` should print 60 - the product of `3 * 4 * 5`
- For any other operation print `Operation is not supported!`
- Skip all not numeric value
- If there are no numeric values, print `There is nothing to add` (or multiply)
